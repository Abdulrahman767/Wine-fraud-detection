Wine Fraud Detection

Overview:

Created a model to detect potential wine fraud based on various quality and type features. The project highlighted crucial findings and model performance scores:

Data Exploration:

1-Explored the wine fraud dataset to understand the distribution of quality and type features.

2-Important Finding: Fraudulent wines were more likely to have lower quality scores.

3-Calculated and visualized the percentage of different wine types and qualities.

Model Implementation:

1-Mapped wine quality as a binary target (fraud or legitimate) and applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) with GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters.

2-Performance Score: Achieved an accuracy of 84%, with a precision of 0.85 for fraud detection.

3-Evaluated the model's performance through confusion matrix and classification report metrics.
